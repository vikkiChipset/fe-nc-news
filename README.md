# NC News

[**NC News**](https://unique-pegasus-2b6e44.netlify.app/) is a social news platform for sharing, rating, and discussing contentâ€”a bit like Reddit. Users can post articles, comment on existing posts, and engage with others by upvoting or downvoting articles and comments.


The front-end is built with React and styled with CSS, and the site is hosted on Netlify:
